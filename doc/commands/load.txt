load: Load one or more modules.
usage: load <module> [<module>...]

  Loads the configuration for one or more modules. You can use either the short
  name or the qualified name for a module. If the short name is provided, the
  default version is used if available, otherwise the module with the highest
  version number is used.

  If you provide more than one <module> argument, all modules are loaded
  individually in the order in which they appeared. If one of the module fails
  to load, it will not affect the others (unless they are dependent on the
  failed module). If a later module may replace an earlier one, it will do so.
  This is especially true for different versions of the same module: by design,
  only one version of a module can only be ever active. If an already loaded
  module is loaded again, it will be ignored.
