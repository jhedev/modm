help: Show help on Modm usage, Modm commands or available modules.
usage: help [<command/module>]

  The help command displays information on various aspects of Modm. If invoked
  without arguments, general usage information is shown. You can also specify
  one additional argument (more arguments are silently ignored), which can be
  either a command or a module name.

  If a <command> is specified, the built-in help for this command will be shown.
  This is a list of commands for which you can get help:
  - avail, status
  - config
  - help
  - list
  - load
  - unload

  If a <module> is specified, the help text provided by the module will be
  shown. You may either specify the short name or the qualified name for a
  module. In case you have a module with the same name as one of the built-in
  Modm commands, use the qualified name or add a path separator character to the
  short name (on Unix-like systems it is '/', on Windows it is '\') in order to
  indicate that you are looking for the module and not the command help.
